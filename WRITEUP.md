### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*
- In this project I chose App service to deploy, this is a small project, so choosing an app service is the most appropriate. Because it is cheaper cost and faster setup compared with Vitural machine.
- The App Service:
  + Simplicity and Ease of Use
  + Typically more cost-effective, various pricing tiers including a free tier
  + Auto-scaling, built-in load balancing
  + Built-in security features, managed backups
- Virtual Machines (VMs):
   + Requires manual setup and management, full control over the OS
   + Potentially higher costs, pay-as-you-go based on VM size, storage, and network usage
   + Manual scaling, custom load balancing
   + Custom security configurations, manual backup setup and management
### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
